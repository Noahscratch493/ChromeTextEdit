<h1>The License for ChromeTextEdit</h1>
<p>The License for ChromeTextEdit is Kinda Strange.</p>
<p>You can modify, download and publish a new version of ChromeTextEdit.</p>
<p>If You want to modify and publish your new version of ChromeTextEdit, you must give credit to the creator of ChromeTextEdit, Noahscratch493</p>
<p>If you downloaded and edited someone else's version of ChromeTextEdit, you must credit Noahscratch493 and the creator who made the version you downloaded that wasn't by Noahscratch493.<p>
<p>If you modify someone else's version, make sure you use the Licence they are using too so there aren't any consequences between the creator of the version of ChromeTextEdit.<p>
